abstract = {Complete characterization of states and processes that occur within quantum devices is crucial for understanding and testing their potential to outperform classical technologies for communications and computing. However, solving this task with current state-of-the-art techniques becomes unwieldy for large and complex quantum systems. Here we realize and experimentally demonstrate a method for complete characterization of a quantum harmonic oscillator based on an artificial neural network known as the restricted Boltzmann machine. We apply the method to optical homodyne tomography and show it to allow full estimation of quantum states based on a smaller amount of experimental data compared to state-of-the-art methods. We link this advantage to reduced overfitting. Although our experiment is in the optical domain, our method provides a way of exploring quantum resources in a broad class of large-scale physical systems, such as superconducting circuits, atomic and molecular ensembles, and optomechanical systems.},

The full information on the N-mode quantum state is obtained by controlling both the relative amplitudes and the phases of the modes, which simplifies the reconstruction of density matrices to only N + 1 Fourier transforms. In particular, this method yields time-correlated multimode density matrices of optical pulses by superimposing the signal by a sequence of short local-oscillator pulses."

abstract = {Quantum-enhanced measurements using squeezed states of light provide sensitivities beyond the shot noise limit. Although the mechanism of quantum enhancement is well described by quantum mechanics, it is difficult to intuitively understand how squeezed states are exploited. In this paper, we present a pictorial interpretation of quantum-enhanced measurements using wave functions, which provides intuitive pictures of squeezed states in various experimental systems.},

abstract = {Balanced detection, which is becoming increasingly essential for wireless communication and optical fiber communication, has been extensively studied in recent years. However, the relationships between the sensitivity and the other parameters have not yet been comprehensively ascertained. In this work, the relationship between the sensitivity and the local oscillator power Plo, consistency parameter $\Delta$$\alpha$, and beam splitting ratio $\epsilon$ in balanced detection is explored through numerical and communication system simulations. If $\epsilon$ decreases, the sensitivity increases, and the corresponding Plo decreases. With the increase or decrease in $\Delta$$\alpha$, $\epsilon$ corresponding to the minimum sensitivity shifts toward the right or left, respectively. This shift increases with the increase in the absolute value of $\Delta$$\alpha$, and the minimum value of the sensitivity increases. When the absolute values of $\Delta$$\alpha$ are equal, their curves are almost symmetrical. As $\epsilon$ approaches 0.5, the tolerable maximum of Plo becomes higher. At any instant, the average value of the quantum efficiency of the two photodiodes is more critical than the maximum quantum efficiency and balance. This work facilitates thorough understanding of the sensitivity of balanced detection, which can be beneficial for future optical communication design.},

abstract = {The time-domain balanced homodyne detector (TBHD) is critical component in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD). The shot-noise-limited attribute of a TBHD depends on the whole frequency spectrum of the detector, in contrast to a frequency-domain balanced homodyne detector that focuses only on part of the frequency spectrum. We propose a method for accurate calibration of the shot-noise-limited attribute of the TBHD by overlapping the gain lines of the TBHD and an integral photodetector which is realized by blocking one photodiode of the TBHD. The overlapping of two lines indicates that the detector is indeed shot noise limited, which is crucial to the security of CVQKD. Experimentally, we use this method to obtain a calibration error of {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater}               {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\$\{\textblackslash\}pm 1\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}            {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater}{\textperthousand}. Theoretical analysis showed that the CVQKD security is very sensitive to calibration errors of shot noise, and proper countermeasure was proposed to eliminate this issue. The presented methods are expected to contribute to CVQKD security and TBHD standardization.},

On the other hand, as a phase-sensitive device, the detector should be free of the 3 dB extra quantum noise, as verified by a recent experiment. However, the mechanism for the absence of the 3 dB noise penalty in the experimental observation remains unknown. To understand the relevant physics, we develop a comprehensive quantum theory, in agreement with experiment, for phase-sensitive heterodyne detection.

Two existing theoretical models are briefly reviewed, with one model predicting a 3\&\#x00A0;dB quantum noise floor change in detection of two-mode squeezed light if the local oscillator is replaced by a monochromatic one, whereas the other model foretells the same noise floor no matter which local oscillator is used. An experiment on heterodyne detection of two-mode squeezed light is carried out to put the two models under test. No significant difference in the noise floor level is observed between the two detectors, showing the noiseless property of both detectors. This work should be of importance for the understanding of noise origin in optical detection and of great interest in practical application for squeezing-enhanced audio band gravitational-wave signal searching.},

abstract = {Cross correlation heterodyne detectors exhibit the potential for suppression of the detection quantum noise below shot noise without use of optical squeezing for capturing weak optical signals in low frequency bands. To understand the underlying mechanism, we develop a quantum theory to describe the noise performance of cross correlation heterodyne detectors. By calculating the cross spectral density (CSD) of the photocurrent fluctuations from a cross correlation heterodyne detector, we prove that its noise performance can break the shot noise limit and exceed that of a regular heterodyne detector for detection of coherent light. When the detected light signal is in a squeezed state, we show that the corresponding CSD value is negative and discuss how a negative CSD may be explored to improve the output signal-to-noise ratio of the detector contaminated by classical noises through tuning the parameter of the degree of squeezing. This work may find itself useful in space-based gravitational wave searching and a variety of other scientific research activities, such as observation of vacuum magnetic birefringence and telecommunications.},
