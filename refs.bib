ABSTRACT = {This article describes the current technical level of developments in the field of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). Various classifications are described, the criteria are analyzed, and the optimal protocol is selected. The analysis is focused around device-dependent schemes with a theoretical emphasis, and therefore, a detailed analysis of device-independent CV-QKD and side-channel attacks is out of the scope of the work. However, the latter, one way or another, is taken into account when describing possible classifications. The choice of the optimal protocol was carried out, first of all, from the potential possibility of integration into existing network telecommunication infrastructures. Predominantly, the general classification is carried out in such a way that it is possible to draw up a specific protocol, depending on the task of implementation.},

ABSTRACT = {The ability to distribute secret keys between two parties with information-theoretic security, that is regardless of the capacities of a malevolent eavesdropper, is one of the most celebrated results in the field of quantum information processing and communication. Indeed, quantum key distribution illustrates the power of encoding information on the quantum properties of light and has far-reaching implications in high-security applications. Today, quantum key distribution systems operate in real-world conditions and are commercially available. As with most quantum information protocols, quantum key distribution was first designed for qubits, the individual quanta of information. However, the use of quantum continuous variables for this task presents important advantages with respect to qubit-based protocols, in particular from a practical point of view, since it allows for simple implementations that require only standard telecommunication technology. In this review article, we describe the principle of continuous-variable quantum key distribution, focusing in particular on protocols based on coherent states. We discuss the security of these protocols and report on the state-of-the-art in experimental implementations, including the issue of side-channel attacks. We conclude with promising perspectives in this research field.},

abstract = {It is well known that the Q function which contains the complete information about the quantum state can be measured in a perfect eight-port homodyne detection scheme. A reconstruction formula for the density matrix elements in the photon number basis from a given Q function based on integrals rather than derivatives of the Q function has been recently derived \[1\]. In this paper we propose alternative schemes to reconstruct the photon statistics and density matrix, respectively, from double homodyne detection measurements. To this end the signal field is first split into two beams by a 50/50 beam splitter. Then the two output beams are directed on separate balanced homodyne detectors and the measured joint quadrature distribution P(x1, x2, $\Theta$1, $\Theta$2) for the quadrature components x1 and x2 belonging to the local oscillator phases $\Theta$1 and $\Theta$2 respectively, is considered. Note, that in our scheme the phases $\Theta$1,2 are adjustable independently from each other. In this sense we generalize the eight-port homodyne detection scheme for measurements of the Q function.},

Novel theoretical protocols are designed on a regularbasis, security proofs are constantly improving, and experiments aregradually moving from proof-of-principle lab demonstrations to in-fieldimplementations and technological prototypes. In this paper, we provideboth a general introduction and a state-of-the-art description of therecent advances in the field, both theoretical and experimental. We startby reviewing protocols of quantum key distribution based on discretevariable systems. Next we consider aspects of device independence,satellite challenges, and protocols based on continuous-variable systems.We will then discuss the ultimate limits of point-to-point privatecommunications and how quantum repeaters and networks may overcome theserestrictions. Finally, we will discuss some aspects of quantumcryptography beyond standard quantum key distribution, including quantumrandom number generators and quantum digital signatures.},

abstract = {In a recent research (Olivares et al., 2019 [18]) we have demonstrated that a homodyne-like scheme, exploiting a “low-intensity” local oscillator, can be used to perform optical state tomography of both quantum and classical states of light. The reconstruction method directly uses the homodyne-like probability distribution retrieved from the detector. Here, we further investigate the role played by the local oscillator in this respect. In particular, we study to some extent how its intensity affects the quantum-state reconstruction procedure by focusing on the case of the Fock states |1〉 and |2〉, whose homodyne-like probability distributions are sensibly affected by the actual value of the LO intensity. The analysis is performed on Monte Carlo simulated experiments taking also into account the quantum detection efficiency.}
