\section{Abstract}
The statistical photon count distribution in homodyne measurement is well known. From the exact formulae, it is possible to obtain the so-called strong local oscillator approximation, which reveals some properties of the signal state. For this approximation to accurately describe a physical process, an appropriate positive-valued operator measure (POVM) must be constructed.

Our analysis focuses on the case of an unbalanced beam splitter and unequal non-unity quantum efficiency of the photodetectors, which we refer to as the asymmetrical case, in contrast to the traditionally studied symmetrical case of a balanced beam splitter and equal non-unity quantum efficiencies. We derive {the} approximation {of the exact photon count distribution by virtue of approximating Poisson distribution with a Gaussian} and construct the corresponding Gaussian POVM for the asymmetrical case. {We find that this approximation accurately corresponds to the exact distribution, even in edge cases when the strong Local Oscillator approximation no longer applies, and the respective POVM is always well-defined. We successfully applied the same method of POVM construction to another homodyne-based scheme, double (8-port) homodyne.}

Our findings indicate that the traditional method of approximating the Skellam distribution using the asymptotic expansion of the modified Bessel function of the first kind leaves the POVM unidentified for most of the system's parameters.

Homodyning is a fundamental technique in quantum optics.
%why fundamental
Its' importance results from belonging to Gaussian measurement class \cite{weedbrook2012gaussian}. Being a Gaussian measurement, homodyne measurement projects quantum states onto Gaussian states, specifically eigenstates of the quadrature operators~\cite{braunstein1990homodyne}.%, allowing for analysis of the phase-dependent quadratures of the electric field of light.
%applications
This property allows for the effective measurement of continuous-variable (CV) quantum states, which are characterized by their Gaussian distributions in phase space~\cite{serafini2017quantum}.
%CV-QKD
Consequently, homodyne-based measurements are widely applied in
%homodyne measurement are essential in 
quantum state tomography~\cite{d2003quantum,OPATRNY1997112, PhysRevA.54.856, walker1986multiport} and reconstruction~\cite{welsch1999ii,PhysRevA.53.4528, Olivares_2019, PhysRevA.48.4598}, as well as in
continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems~\cite{PhysRevLett.88.057902,PhysRevLett.93.170504,RevModPhys.84.621,e17096072,opt3040030,10.1063/5.0179566}

%and other quantum information applications~\cite{rusca2020fast, gehring2021homodyne, hu2023progress}.
%tomography
%Of equal significance, homodyne measurement are essential in quantum state tomography~\cite{d2003quantum},
%
%as well as in quantum state preparation  and transformation~\cite{Zhang_2019}.

The homodyne measurement scheme involves a beamsplitter (BS), where the two input ports are occupied by the signal and reference (also often called Local Oscillator, LO) modes, and the two output ports are detected by quantum detectors, then the difference between outputs is calculated. Because of calculating the difference, the excess noise cancels out.
%how it works
%scheme
%exact statistics
%Exact statistical distributions of photon counts difference in homodyne scheme can be derived %\cite{kelley1964theory}. 
%LO approximation
To reveal properties of signal state, one can consider the reference mode to be much stronger in amplitude than the signal, leading to the so-called strong LO approximation, which yields  average of quadrature operator of signal mode (for comprehensive review see Ref.{~\cite{vogel2006quantum}}).

%relevant literature review


%schemes
%In context of noise, it is usually discussed as an inherent quality of LO.
%unbalanced
%Ref.{~\cite{PhysRevA.53.4528}} discusses the technique of unbalanced homodyne detection (in the sense of only one quantum detector used as opposed to traditionally detecting both output ports of BS). It shows that reconstructing the quantum state of the signal field from the photocounting statistics recorded in this scheme (related to $s$-parametrized quasiprobability distributions) is possible for $s<1$. To do so, POVM is derived.
%        Practically this scheme is difficult to realize: the noise is significant,  presently available photomultipliers have small efficiencies, so that the applicability of the method might be presently limited to the reconstruction of smooth quasiprobability distributions. A possible solution is to use of an array of highly efficient avalanche photodiodes instead of photon count detectors~\cite{PhysRevA.53.4528, PhysRevA.101.031801}. Naturally, theoretical description (photon count formula) is to be modified as well \cite{PhysRevA.85.023820,PhysRevA.92.053835}.
%In Ref.~\cite{wallentowitz1996unbalanced} it is shown that this detection scheme can be used for reconstructing the state. Quality of the results of reconstruction are affected by quantum detector efficiency, being less accurate for lower efficiencies.
%our is balanced in this sense
%As previously mentioned, these studies focus on the critical case of imbalance (one of the detector ports being unused) for special measurement purposes. In contrast, our study focuses on the conventional homodyne scheme, accounting for the non-ideal behavior of the BS and the detectors’ efficiencies mismatch. In this sense, the case with an unused port can be interpreted as zero efficiency.
%noise appears bc of scheme
%For considered in this study case, our findings indicate that even for perfect LO noise is present for non-perfect homodyne schemes, directly dependent on imperfections parameters.

%correlation POVM
%In Ref.~\cite{K_hn_2018}, similarly to our research, imperfections of both BS and detectors are taken into account, and a POVM of homodyne correlation measurements is derived. 


%double homodyne
%multiport
%\hl{Generalization of homodyne measurement is "multiport" homodyne with $N$ inputs and outputs {\cite{doi:10.1080/09500348714550131}}, finding application in multimode state reconstruction {\cite{PhysRevA.54.856}}}

%weak LO
%While we focus on strong LO, case of weak LO may be interesting as well. It finds its' application in optical homodyne tomography (See e.g.{\cite{Olivares_2019}}.% Our treatment of weak LO is not rigorous, since we use the approximation derived in assumption that the LO to be much greater than $1$, and then plug-in comparable to $1$ values in the result to analyze it. More correct approach would be as described in Ref.{~\cite{CIVESESCLOP2000153}}, as to find the eigenstates assosiated with assumption that LO is finite (and so, it is not eigenstates of quadrature operator).}
\hl{%povm
For the resulting statistical distribution derived in strong LO approximation to accurately describe a real physical process, it is necessary to construct the corresponding positive-valued operator measure (POVM). For ideal balanced homodyne and balanced homodyne with unequal detector effeciencies POVM is well-known, being projectors onto quadrature operators and superposition of these projectors, respectively. 
However, deviations from 50:50 BS, while simple, have not been carried out. Moreover, the same considerations have not been carried out for double homodyne scheme.
%Asymmetrical -- def
%Moreover, it is important to take into account imperfections of the scheme, always present in real experiments.

%LO intensity
Numerical studies of difference photon count distributions for different signal states in homodyne schemes have been performed~\cite{freyberger1993photon}. In this work photon difference distributions for Fock signal states was analyzed, and dependency of detector efficiencies was studied. However, dependency of quality of the LO approximation compared to exact distribution has not been quantified. A numerical study on the role of the LO intensity in an imperfect homodyne scheme has been conducting in Ref.~\cite{OLIVARES2020126354}. The homodyne scheme has non-unity equal quantum detectors and a balanced BS. It shows that strong LO is not required to reconstruct a quantum state, and low intesity LO can provide a reconstruction with sufficient fidelity, which increases as increases LO intensity. 

%real LO
%While traditionally in description of homodyne scheme LO is assumed to be coherent, several studies have been conducting using LO

%objectives
The aim of this study is to derive  Gaussian POVMs of homodyne and homodyne-based schemes in "asymmetrical" case, which is how we will refer to the case of non-ideal (transmission coefficient not equal to reflection coefficient) BS and unequal quantum efficiencies of the detectors. \hl{To some degree deviations from balanced homodyne are always present in real experiments}.
The main objectives of this study are
to showcase the derivation of the strong LO Gaussian approximation and analyze its' limitations in considered case, and obtaining corresponding Gaussian POVM.

%Our analysis focuses on the case of an unbalanced beam splitter and unequal non-unity quantum efficiency of photodetectors, which we refer to as the asymmetrical case, in contrast to the traditionally studied symmetrical case of a balanced beam splitter and equal non-unity quantum efficiencies.  

%!%!%outline
The paper is organized as follows.
In Sec.~\ref{sec-homodyne}, we provide the derivation statistical distribution of difference photon counts.
To obtain the approximation of it, we approximate the Poisson distribution with the Gaussian distribution, obtaining Gaussian approximation. We will use the strong LO approximation to further simplify the resulting function. After this, we construct the respective POVM.
We thoroughly analyze the dependence of quality of the Gaussian approximation on asymmetry parameters -- coefficients of transmission and reflection of the BS and relationship between quantum efficiencies of the detectors.
In Sec.~\ref{sec-double-homodyne}, we apply developed in the previous section formalism to another homodyne-based detection scheme, namely double homodyne scheme (also referenced as heterodyne scheme in QKD literature{~\cite{Pirandola:20,opt3040030,10.1063/5.0179566}}), to demonstrate applicability of the formalism.
%In Sec.~\ref{sec-experiment}, a number of experiments are performed and the experimental results are analyzed. %xd
In Sec.~\ref{sec-results}, we present our findings from analytical and numerical analysis and discuss them.
Finally, in Sec.~\ref{sec-conclusion}, we conclude the paper with a brief summary of the key results and suggestions of future development of our theoretical formalism.
%{Our findings also reveal that the approach of approximating the Skellam distribution using the asymptotic expansion of the modified Bessel function of the first kind is not applicable for POVM construction in the asymmetrical case, which we discuss in Appendix{~\ref{app:bessel}}}

\section{Results and discussion}\label{sec-results}
We have derived the Gaussian approximation for the asymmetrical case of the homodyne scheme and used it to construct a well-defined POVM. This POVM is applicable across all parameter settings of the scheme. Our results both agree and extend the existing relations~\cite{braunstein1990homodyne}.

We evaluated the accuracy of our approximation {for all asymmetry parameters, namely relationship and absolute values of quantum detectors' efficiencies and transmission/reflection coefficieciets of the beamsplitter, as well as the dependance on signal and reference mode amplitudes}. Our findings indicate that the quality of the agreement between the exact and approximate solutions varies with the degree of asymmetry. By varying parameters of BS we may achieve the best approximation for given quantum efficiencies and vice versa. Results agree with other works on this subject, such as \cite{OLIVARES2020126354}. {We have found that Gaussian approximation is adequate even in edge cases of very weak LO amplitude or full transmission/reflection of BS.}

Developed formalism allows us to easily analyze various homodyne-based detection schemes. It can be extended to describe more complex measurement systems. We showcased this by analyzing the $8$-port double homodyne scheme. However, we encountered a problem with definition of Gaussian function, which needs further investigating. \hl{We presume that it is connected to usage of squeezed coherent states, see Ref.{~\cite{doi:10.1080/09500348714550131}}}

Additionally, we found that the {Skellam distribution approximation}, traditionally used for the strong Local Oscillator approximation, is not suitable for the asymmetrical case. 

%Comment on experimental data

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec-conclusion}
We developed a method of constructing the respective POVM of homodyne-based detection schemes. This method relies on approximating the exact statistics {of photon count difference} with Gaussian approximation. We applied this method to write POVM for homodyne and double homodyne schemes. For the double homodyne scheme, we have encountered a problem with our approach, {and our constructed POVM is not defined for all parameters of the scheme as expected}. This problem needs further investigating. Moreover, we have studied the applicability of Gaussian approximation in case of unequal non-unity quantum efficiency of photodetectors and unbalanced beam splitters. We have found that the usual approach of approximating the Skellam distribution using the asymptotic expansion of the modified Bessel function
of the first kind is not applicable in the asymmetrical case. {This is due to extremely poor quality of approximation and inability to construct the respective POVM with terms caused by asymmetry.}
